        <p>We retain your data only for as long as necessary to fulfill its purpose or comply with legal requirements. We do not keep data indefinitely without a valid reason. Your data may be stored on our servers or cloud services, and after the retention period, it is either deleted or anonymized.

        <h3>5. Protection of Minors</h3>
        <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under the age of consent as per applicable laws.
